Command line tools for exporting org-mode to various media.

Provides non-interactive compilation of org-mode files. These scripts
(er, well, one script for now) will download necessary dependencies
and does not rely on (or consult) the user's own emacs configuration.

By default, a new folder is created in ~/.org-export the first time a
script is executed, and dependencies (such as the most recent version
of org-mode) are installed using elpa.

* Installation

Well, there isn't any, really. At the moment just drop the org2html.el
someplace on your $PATH. Or not.

* Requirements

- GNU emacs 24.x


* org2html.el

Export org-mode to html

Command line arguments:
- -infile      :: Input org-mode file.
- -outfile     :: Output html file.
- -package-dir :: Directory into which required packages will be
                  downloaded and installed [default ~/.org-export].
- -css-url     :: URL or path for a css stylesheet [default
                  http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/assets/css/bootstrap.css].

Example:

: ./org2html.el -infile README.org -outfile README.html

Uses a minimally modified Bootstrap
(http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) css theme by default. Be nice:
the default url uses an asset hosted on github.io, so the polite thing
to do would be to change this to something self-hosted for anything
high volume.
